        <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>250g white rice</li>
                <li>500ml water</li>
                <li>salt</li>
                <li>1-2 table spoons oil or ghee</li>
            </ul>
            <h3> Optinal </h3>
            <ul><li>A few pandan leaves or cinnamon stick for added aroma</li></ul> 
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Measure 250g of white rice using a kitchen scale or measuring cup.</li>
                <li>lace the rice in a bowl or fine-mesh strainer. Rinse under cold running water until the water 
                    runs clear, removing excess starch. This helps prevent the rice from becoming too sticky.</li>
                <li>Soak the rinsed rice in water for about 15-30 minutes. This step is optional but can help the grains cook more evenly.</li>
                <li>After soaking, drain the rice well.</li>
                <li>In a pot, combine the drained rice with approximately 500ml of water. 
                    Adjust the water if needed based on your rice variety and desired texture.</li>
                <li>Add salt to taste (optional). You can also add oil or ghee for extra flavor, if desired.</li>
                <li>Place the pot over medium-high heat and bring the water to a boil.</li>
                <li>Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes. 
                    Avoid lifting the lid during cooking.</li>
                <li>After 15-20 minutes, check if the water has been absorbed and the rice is tender. If itâ€™s not done, cover and cook for a few more minutes.</li>
                <li>Once cooked, remove the pot from heat and let it sit, covered, for about 5 minutes. Then, fluff the rice gently with a fork.</li>
                <li>Transfer the rice to a serving dish and enjoy it with your favorite curries or side dishes!</li>
             </ol>
